# Prudential-Life-Insurance

The project is done in R using H20,ggplot2 and shiny package to explore and predict the Prudential Life insurance data.
The data exploration using ggplot2 and shiny package of R while the modeling process has been performed by the team, using H2o.
It explores various features of H2O, ggplot2 and shiny package.

H2O is an open source machine learning platform which is Java Virtual Machine capable for doing in memory processing of distributed, 
parallel machine algorithms on clusters. H2O provides functions for building GLM, GBM, Kmeans, Naive Bayes, Principal Components Analysis,
Principal Components Regression, Random Forests and Deep Learning (multi-layer neural net models) with impressive execution speeds.
H20 can be used for high performance Machine Learning in R. It provides a GUI driven platform for doing faster data computations.
